# Withdrawing an MCP release

The **Withdraw MCP Release** workflow removes an unintended public release. It
does not modify `main` or change the version in `mcp-local/server.json`.

The workflow uses the dedicated `DOCKERHUB_WITHDRAW_USERNAME` and
`DOCKERHUB_WITHDRAW_SECRET` GitHub Actions secrets. Make them available to the
`production` job. The withdrawal credential must have read, write, and delete
access to `armlimited/arm-mcp`.

For example, to withdraw `4.2.0` and restore `4.1.0`:

```bash
gh workflow run withdraw-mcp-release.yml \
  --repo arm/mcp \
  --ref main \
  -f withdraw_version=4.2.0 \
  -f restore_version=4.1.0 \
  -f confirmation=withdraw
```

Before requesting production approval, the workflow validates the versions,
releases, and image digests and records them in the run summary. After approval,
it moves `latest` to the fallback image, deletes the version and
architecture-specific Docker tags, and marks the fallback GitHub release as
latest. It retains the Git tag and marks the GitHub release as withdrawn while
preserving its original notes.

The workflow can be rerun if an earlier attempt only completed some of these
steps.

Leave `main` at the withdrawn version; that version is used and must not be
republished. Choose the next version according to the reason for the withdrawal.
For example, skip to the next minor version with:

```bash
gh workflow run build-mcp-image.yml \
  --repo arm/mcp \
  --ref main \
  -f release_action=minor
```

Use `hotfix` or `major` instead when that is the appropriate next version.

## Suspected malicious release

This workflow does not cover releases involving suspected malicious code or a
repository or credential compromise. Follow the security incident response
process instead.
