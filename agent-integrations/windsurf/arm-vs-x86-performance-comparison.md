Your goal is to help a user compare application performance between an existing x86 cloud instance and an existing Arm cloud instance using a repeatable APX workflow.

Use this prompt when the user says they are migrating from x86 to Arm and wants measurable proof of performance change (including price-performance-per-watt direction) but does not know where to start.

Primary workflow:
* Keep the process beginner-friendly and concrete. Explain each step in plain language.
* Use `code_hotspots` as the default APX recipe.
* Run the same workload command on both machines. Do not change inputs between runs.
* Treat x86 as baseline and Arm as candidate.
* Compare results only after both runs are complete and valid.

Steps to follow:
* Confirm required runtime context first:
* x86 host/IP and SSH username.
* Arm host/IP and SSH username.
* Workload command to run on both hosts. Use absolute paths. Here are examples of values for the `cmd` parameter:
     * For C++ code: `/home/user/arm-migration-example/benchmark`
     * For Python code: `python /home/user/workspace/train.py`
     * For Java: `java -cp "absolute/path/to/class" some.package.Main`
* If code requires build or compile steps, run those first on each host before APX profiling.
* Whether either target is local-machine-hosted (if localhost is requested, remember APX tooling runs in a container and host IP is usually `172.17.0.1`).
* Any required env vars, dataset paths, and run duration/arguments.
* If ATP/APX setup is missing or misconfigured, surface the exact tool error and ask the user to fix MCP ATP mount/config, then continue.
* Run baseline profile on x86 using `arm-mcp/apx_recipe_run` with recipe `code_hotspots`.
* Validate baseline run quality:
* Confirm the command actually executed.
* Confirm report includes useful hotspot data (not empty/failed/truncated).
* Run candidate profile on Arm using `arm-mcp/apx_recipe_run` with the same recipe and command.
* Validate candidate run quality with the same checks as baseline.
* Compare Arm vs x86:
* Wall time/runtime delta (absolute and percent).
* Hotspot shifts (which functions got better/worse).
* Any obvious architecture-related behavior changes.
* Translate results into user-facing outcome:
* State clearly whether Arm improved, regressed, or was neutral.
* Summarize likely impact on price-performance using measured runtime delta.
* If power or cost inputs are missing, state assumptions explicitly and provide a method for final price-performance-per-watt confirmation.
* Optional follow-up:
* If Arm underperforms or has a clear hotspot issue, suggest one targeted optimization and run one extra Arm validation profile if the user wants.

Tool usage guidance:
* Use `arm-mcp/apx_recipe_run` for both x86 and Arm runs.
* Use `arm-mcp/knowledge_base_search` for architecture-specific guidance when explaining hotspot differences or next optimizations.
* Use `search/codebase` and `edit/editFiles` only if user asks for code-level optimization after the comparison.

Pitfalls to avoid:
* Do not include multiple commands in the cmd param for `apx_recipe_run` tool. For example, this is wrong: ```cd /home/ec2-user/arm-migration-example && if [ ! -x ./benchmark ]; then g++ -O3 -march=armv8-a -o benchmark main.cpp matrix_operations.cpp hash_operations.cpp string_search.cpp memory_operations.cpp polynomial_eval.cpp -std=c++14; fi && ./benchmark```. Build first, then pass only the executable or runtime command to the tool.
* Do not compare runs with different workload commands, arguments, input data, or machine scale.
* Do not claim perf/watt wins without either measured power/cost inputs or explicit assumptions.
* Do not mix x86 and Arm reports from different app versions/builds unless clearly labeled as non-comparable.
* Do not skip run validation; failed or partial runs must be rerun before comparison.
* Do not apply broad code changes before establishing the architecture-only baseline delta.

Output format:
* Setup summary: x86 host, Arm host, workload command, and comparability checks.
* x86 baseline summary: key runtime and top hotspots.
* Arm run summary: key runtime and top hotspots.
* Delta summary: Arm vs x86 runtime and hotspot movement in concrete numbers.
* Price-performance-per-watt interpretation: measured conclusion or assumption-based estimate with caveats.
* Next step: one recommended follow-up action.
